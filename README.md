## lab5 - Backend to blog
This is the backend to the blog app that we made in lab 4. It is hosted on Heroku. Go to http://ogrenblogs.surge.sh/ to check out the App. 

Extra Credit:
I added comments to the backend and then made changes to the frontend to include comments. So, now when you click on a post, you see the comments in a section at the bottom and you can also add a comment in that section, which will then be displayed at the bottom.
